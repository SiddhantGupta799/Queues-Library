# Queues-Library

This Library contains the Implementation of Queues and Priority Queues.

Queues are Implemented using the BinaryNode, and is a two - pointer based Queue thereby providing push and pop operations in constant time.

Priority Queues are set default to contain 10 priorities in, of which the lower index indicates higher priority, and therefore popping operations work accordingly
